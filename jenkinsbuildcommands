Try below different scenarios to check the status:
for Build Steps:
Senario:1 : Fail
Executing the build step in Sritest for docker
# Create the Docker image
sudo docker build /home/ubuntu/jenkins/workspace/sritestjob1 -t developapp
sudo docker run -it -d 81:80 developapp

Senario:2 Success how ever port will be used by container
In the previous setup docker image creation error occurred due to -d changing the build setup
using -p instead of -d and also the workspace directory for job one was sritestjob-1
(-1) is creating problems due to Jenkins switches creating new job sritestjob1 copying existing
Also, ensure that the docker file follows standards with caps and normal letters for commands.

# Create the Docker image
sudo docker build /home/ubuntu/jenkins/workspace/sritestjob1 -t developapp
# Run the Docker image in a container
sudo docker run -itd -p 81:80 developapp

#senario:3:  deleting the allocated port and re-assessing to docker build

#List all stopped containers, Get the container IDs of all stopped containers,Remove all stopped containers, regardless of whether they are running or have unsaved data.
sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
# Create the Docker image
sudo docker build /home/ubuntu/jenkins/workspace/sritestjob1 -t developapp
# Run the Docker image in a container
sudo docker run -itd -p 81:80 developapp
